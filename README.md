# React Router v6 Unexpected Route Behavior

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug related to route handling in React Router v6 when dealing with nested paths and dynamic segments. Specifically, the issue arises when a route with a dynamic segment (`/users/:id`) is defined in a way that can clash with another route or a direct navigation to the dynamic segment without a parent path.

## Problem Description

The `bug.js` file contains a React component that uses `react-router-dom` v6 to define routes.  The problem occurs when a user tries to access a path like `/users/123`. If there isn't a preceding route to handle this in a structured manner, this may lead to unexpected behavior or errors in the application, such as incorrect route matching or component rendering errors, especially if the dynamic segment's value is not properly handled.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a solution by implementing better route structure and adding necessary checks for handling the dynamic segment's values correctly and ensuring routes do not conflict, thereby preventing the unexpected behavior described above.
